# SyncSplice ðŸŽ¬ðŸŽµ
**Random Video Slice + Audio Mashup Tool**

SyncSplice is a simple Python + Tkinter desktop app that takes any short audio file and pairs it with a random segment from a longer video (segment length = audio length + 1 second).
The result is exported as an MP4 (`H.264` video + `AAC` audio) using [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/).

It was used as a way to put narration over a random minecraft parkour clip for TikTok. Maybe You'll find a different way to use it.
