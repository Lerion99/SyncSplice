# SyncSplice
A simple Python + Tkinter app that takes any short audio file and pairs it with a random segment from a longer video (segment length = audio length + 1s). The result is exported as an MP4 (H.264/AAC) using FFmpeg. Includes a clean desktop UI, live progress bar, and reproducible random seeds. Works great on Linux, including Steam Deck.
